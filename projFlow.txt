Builing Pipeline:
1. Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local
2. Add src folder along with its all components(run them individually).
3. Add data, models, reports to .gitIgnore file
4. now git add-commit-push.

Setting up dvc pipeline(without Params)
5. Create dvc.yaml file and add stages to it.
6. dvc init then do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline automation. (check dvc dag)
7. Now git add, commit, push

Setting up the DVC pipeline(with Params)
8. add params.yaml file
9. add the params setup(mentioned below)
10. Do "dvc repro" to test the pipeline again
11. now git add, commit, push


import yaml
def load_yaml(file_path: str) -> dict:
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            params = yaml.safe_load(f)
        logger.debug(f'Safely readed the data from yaml file at location: {file_path}')
        return params
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f'File not found at path: {e}')
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f'Unwanted Exception raised as: {e}')
